## Questions

### Why Do Companies Use Server-driven UI?

Mobile app releases typically take on the order of weeks with a long-tail of upgrades occurring over a period of months thus slowing down the rate of change with the UI. SDUI attempts to solve this problem by storing the UI on the backend to decouple UI changes from mobile app releases.

For companies like Airbnb[^1] and Shopify[^2], being able to iterate on the UI faster is the core value proposition of SDUI.

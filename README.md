# Server-driven UI Toy

A repository to play with server-driven UI concepts.

## Questions

### Why Do Companies Use Server-driven UI?

Mobile app releases typically take on the order of weeks with a long-tail of
upgrades occurring over a period of months thus slowing down the rate of change
with the UI. SDUI attempts to solve this problem by storing the UI on the
backend to decouple UI changes from mobile app releases.

For companies like Airbnb[^1] and Shopify[^2], being able to iterate on the UI
faster is the core value proposition of SDUI.

### How Do We Design a Server-driven UI System?

Airbnb and Shopify have very similar SDUI systems which consist of:

1. a backend that provides the UI and data required to render that UI.
2. a client framework that can render the backend response for each supported client.
3. a mechanism for developers to modify server components such as config files or a WYSIWYG editor.

### Further Design Questions

- How narrow or wide is the scope of our SDUI system?
- Which clients do we want to support (e.g. web, iOS, Android)?
- Do we want to support advanced client capabilities such as click events, and analytics?
- How easy or hard is it for developers to modify server components?

## Development

- Install the [Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation)
  JavaScript runtime.
- Run the command: `deno task dev`.
